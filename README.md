# organize

This script is a shell script written in Bash. It loops through all the files with the extensions *.MP3, *.docx, *.doc, and *.rtf in the current directory and moves them into subdirectories named after the first 6 characters of their filename.

The script checks if the subdirectory already exists, and if it doesn't, creates it using the mkdir command. The mv command then moves the file into the appropriate subdirectory using the ${f:0:6} syntax, which extracts the first 6 characters of the filename.

The script could be useful for organizing a large number of files with similar naming conventions. However, it is worth noting that it only works for files in the current directory and only moves files with the specified extensions. Additionally, it may not work as expected if there are multiple files with the same first 6 characters in their filename.
